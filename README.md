roman2decimal
=============

Tiny (expanded) code-golf "roman to decimal" challenge solution in multiple
languages.

### Haskell implementation notes

It's pretty bad that I'm using explicit recursion. The canonical solution is
much better, and can be found [here](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Roman_numerals).
